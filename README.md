# multi-host-master-slave
Boot worker instances synchronously with a new config sent via tcp socket.

Note:
The actual code that matters is in `slave.js`.
`master.js` is just used to send in the config and trigger the process.

## Instructions

```bash
$ npm start
# then follow the instructions
```
